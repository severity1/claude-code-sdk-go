# TDD Development Cycle

Execute complete TDD workflow for GitHub issue #$ARGUMENTS with built-in quality gates and Python SDK parity checks.

## Phase 1: Pre-flight Checks

Verify the development environment is ready:

1. **Check working directory status** - Ensure no uncommitted changes exist
2. **Verify current branch** - Should be on `main` branch
3. **Pull latest changes** - Run `git pull` to sync with remote
4. **Check for existing PRs** - Search for open PRs linked to issue #$ARGUMENTS to avoid duplicate work
5. **Verify Go environment** - Run `go version` and ensure toolchain is available
6. **Check for blocking dependencies** - Read issue body and look for "Depends on" or "Blocked by" sections

**STOP and report to user if any check fails** - Don't proceed until issues are resolved.

---

## Phase 2: Issue Validation

Retrieve and analyze issue #$ARGUMENTS:

1. **Fetch issue details** - Get title, body, labels, milestone, state via `gh issue view`
2. **Read all comments** - Check for additional context or decisions made
3. **Validate issue completeness** - Check if issue contains:
   - Summary or description of the feature/fix
   - Proposed Implementation section (most issues have this)
   - Files to Modify section
   - Example Usage (if applicable)

**If incomplete:** Report gaps to user and ask if should proceed anyway.
**If complete:** Display issue summary and continue.

---

## Phase 3: Discovery & Planning

### Codebase Exploration

Understand existing patterns to match the project's conventions:

1. **Review Python SDK Reference:**
   - **Fetch official documentation** using `curl -s https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/agent-sdk/python.md` - this is the authoritative Python SDK API reference
   - Locate corresponding implementation in `../claude-code-sdk-python/` (local clone if available)
   - Understand the behavior that needs 100% parity
   - Note any Go-specific adaptations needed

2. **Discover Existing Patterns:**
   - Search for similar implementations in the codebase
   - Review `client_test.go` as the gold standard for testing patterns
   - Check existing type definitions and interfaces
   - Understand error handling patterns (`fmt.Errorf` with `%w`)

3. **Identify Files to Modify:**
   - Map issue's "Files to Modify" section to actual paths
   - Check for related test files that need updates
   - Note any re-exports needed in `types.go`

4. **Review Related Context:**
   - Read issues mentioned in "Depends on" or "Blocks" sections
   - Check closed PRs for similar features

### Create TDD Implementation Plan

Based on exploration and issue requirements, create detailed plan with:

1. **RED Phase - Tests First:**
   - Test cases to write (based on Python SDK behavior)
   - Expected failures before implementation
   - Table-driven test structure if multiple cases

2. **GREEN Phase - Implementation:**
   - Minimal code to make tests pass
   - Files to create/modify
   - Types and interfaces needed

3. **BLUE Phase - Refactoring:**
   - Code quality improvements
   - Pattern alignment
   - Documentation updates

4. **Acceptance Criteria Mapping:**
   - Map each requirement to test cases
   - Identify how each will be verified

### Critical Checkpoint: User Approval

**Use ExitPlanMode tool to present plan and await user approval before proceeding.**

Do NOT continue to Phase 4 until user approves the plan.

---

## Phase 4: TDD Implementation

### Create Feature Branch

Generate branch name from issue (e.g., Issue #34 "Add plugins support" becomes `feature/issue-34-add-plugins-support`) and create the branch.

### RED Phase: Write Failing Tests

1. **Write test cases first** based on Python SDK behavior
2. **Run tests to verify they fail:**
   ```bash
   go test ./... -v
   ```
3. **Commit failing tests:**
   ```
   test: add tests for <feature> (Issue #$ARGUMENTS)

   - Test case 1 description
   - Test case 2 description
   - Tests expected to fail until implementation
   ```

### GREEN Phase: Implement to Pass Tests

1. **Write minimal implementation** to make tests pass
2. **Run tests to verify they pass:**
   ```bash
   go test ./... -v
   ```
3. **Commit implementation:**
   ```
   feat: implement <feature> (Issue #$ARGUMENTS)

   - Implementation detail 1
   - Implementation detail 2
   - All tests now passing
   ```

### BLUE Phase: Refactor (if needed)

1. **Run quality checks:**
   ```bash
   go fmt ./...
   go vet ./...
   golangci-lint run
   ```
2. **Fix any issues found**
3. **Commit refactoring (if changes made):**
   ```
   refactor: improve <feature> (Issue #$ARGUMENTS)

   - Quality improvement 1
   - Code cleanup
   ```

### Push Feature Branch

Push the feature branch to remote with upstream tracking.

## Phase 5: Self Code Review

Before finalizing, review ALL implemented code for:

### Go Standards Checklist:
- [ ] Idiomatic Go patterns followed
- [ ] Proper error handling with `fmt.Errorf` and `%w` wrapping
- [ ] Context-first for blocking operations (`context.Context` as first param)
- [ ] No unnecessary exports (lowercase unexported unless needed)
- [ ] Interfaces are small and focused
- [ ] Proper use of defer for cleanup

### Security Checklist:
- [ ] No hardcoded secrets or API keys
- [ ] Input validation at system boundaries
- [ ] Buffer limits enforced (1MB protection)
- [ ] No command injection vulnerabilities

### Testing Checklist:
- [ ] Table-driven tests for multiple cases
- [ ] Test helpers call `t.Helper()`
- [ ] Thread-safe mocks with proper mutex usage
- [ ] 100% behavioral parity with Python SDK
- [ ] Edge cases covered (nil, empty, error conditions)
- [ ] No placeholder or dummy test code

### Performance Checklist:
- [ ] No goroutine leaks (proper cleanup)
- [ ] Proper resource cleanup in all paths
- [ ] Efficient buffer management
- [ ] Context cancellation respected

**If issues found:** Fix them and create an additional commit with description of what was fixed.

---

## Phase 6: Validation

### Run Full Test Suite

```bash
go test -cover -race ./...
```

Verify:
1. **All tests pass** - No failures allowed
2. **Coverage acceptable** - Check coverage report
3. **No race conditions** - Race detector finds nothing

### Python SDK Alignment Check

1. **Compare behavior** with Python SDK reference implementation
2. **Reference official docs** - `curl -s https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/agent-sdk/python.md` for API signatures and behavior
3. **Verify 100% parity** on all implemented features
4. **Document any intentional deviations** (Go-specific adaptations)

### Test Authenticity Verification

1. **No placeholder code** - All tests are real and meaningful
2. **No dummy implementations** - Production-ready code only
3. **Proper assertions** - Tests actually verify behavior

### Run Benchmarks (if applicable)

```bash
go test -bench=. -benchmem ./...
```

**STOP if validation fails:** Report issues to user and await instructions.

## Error Recovery

If any phase fails:

1. **Pre-flight/Validation Failures:** Report to user, provide fix suggestions, stop execution
2. **Test Failures (RED phase):** Expected - this is TDD. Continue to GREEN phase
3. **Test Failures (GREEN phase):** Fix implementation until tests pass
4. **Lint/Vet Failures:** Auto-fix where possible with `go fmt`, report unfixable errors
5. **PR Creation Failures:** Report error, provide manual PR creation command

**Branch is preserved** - user can manually inspect, fix, and continue.
